**Programming assignment for the [Udacity React Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019) program.**

# Flashcards

> For the UdaciCards project, you will build a mobile application (Android or iOS - or both) that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.

Built with React Native, Redux and React Navigation. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app#getting-started).
For this assignment there was no starter template provided (apart from the simple backend API).
